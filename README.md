## The Idea Behind This Project

#### What's Wrong With Other Trackers?
My main issue is that meal plans are saved on a calender so when you log back in you start with a blank slate to input the meals for your current day. However I prefer to eat the same meals for a couple weeks, so I find this doesn't work for me. I like to have a record of it to remember what I'm supposed to be cooking and eating without having to search back through the calender. 

#### What's Different About This Tracker?
This tracker allows you create new meal plans but when you log back in you'll see your latest meal plan. You can create as many new plans as you like. Features are simple, no clutter of the fitness app trying to make more money off you by adding more features that only make the app more confusing to navigate and use. 

#### Passion for Fitness
Years ago I lost 110 lbs and have kept it off and ever since developed a passion for fitness and nutrition. What started off as first calculating my calories and macros using a calculator and paper eventually evolved to storing it in a word doc, then to creating more more complex excel spreadsheets with formulas, tables, and graphs to keep track of my meals and progress. So naturally I thought why not take all that knowledge I have built up and centralize it by creating an app that fits my needs.

## How I Worked On This Project

### Planning: User Stories & Features
* I wrote out user stories and features using Notion: [Link to Notion: User Stories & Features](https://hypnotic-saver-f39.notion.site/User-Stories-Features-e3e26a77bbf946be916239d738fc2701)

### Organizing: Task & Bug Tracking
* I organized my work using Notion
* I created a Kanban board using Notion to track tasks and bugs: [Link to Notion: Task & Bug Tracker](https://hypnotic-saver-f39.notion.site/23fcdefb3c024f4f9b767662e899dff4?v=e38bbd8d8a254b16b42fedca9aef405a)
